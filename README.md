### Calculator (October, 14, 2025)

This project is a fully functional calculator built in Processing that supports both mouse clicks and keyboard input. It features a clean, visually balanced interface with a dark background, blue number buttons, and orange operation buttons for clear contrast and usability. Users can perform standard and advanced operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, and pi using either on-screen buttons or keypresses. The program uses event-driven logic to track operands, operators, and results while dynamically updating the display for a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Making Cars (September, 18th, 2025)

This Processing sketch demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating and animating multiple cars on the screen. Each Car object has its own position, color, speed, and direction, and is responsible for drawing and moving itself. An array of cars, along with two individually controlled cars, move continuously across the canvas, wrapping around the screen to create a simple traffic-style animation.

### Graphics Grade (September, 16, 2025)

This Processing sketch visualizes a grading scale by mapping mouse position to a GPA value. As the user moves the mouse horizontally, the program calculates and displays the corresponding letter grade in real time using conditional logic. The project demonstrates interactive graphics, user input handling, and decision-making with if–else statements.
