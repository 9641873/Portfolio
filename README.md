### Fire slime game (December, 9, 2025)

This group project is a 2D platformer game created in Processing with multiple screens, platform-based movement, and dynamic obstacles. My contributions focused on designing and implementing the projectile system, including random spawning from screen edges, movement behavior, and on-screen management. I also assisted with integrating projectiles into the main game loop and contributed ideas for settings functionality. This project demonstrates collaborative development, object-oriented programming, and interactive game design.

### Calculator (October, 14, 2025)

This project is a fully functional calculator built in Processing that supports both mouse clicks and keyboard input. It features a clean, visually balanced interface with a dark background, blue number buttons, and orange operation buttons for clear contrast and usability. Users can perform standard and advanced operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, and pi using either on-screen buttons or keypresses. The program uses event-driven logic to track operands, operators, and results while dynamically updating the display for a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Making Cars (September, 18th, 2025)

This Processing sketch demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating and animating multiple cars on the screen. Each Car object has its own position, color, speed, and direction, and is responsible for drawing and moving itself. An array of cars, along with two individually controlled cars, move continuously across the canvas, wrapping around the screen to create a simple traffic-style animation.

### Graphics Grade (September, 16, 2025)

This Processing sketch visualizes a grading scale by mapping mouse position to a GPA value. As the user moves the mouse horizontally, the program calculates and displays the corresponding letter grade in real time using conditional logic. The project demonstrates interactive graphics, user input handling, and decision-making with if–else statements.

### History Timeline (September, 6, 2025)

This interactive Processing project presents a visual timeline of historic computer systems from 1936 to the 1960s. Users can hover over timeline events to reveal detailed descriptions, combining graphics, text, and mouse interaction. The project highlights early computing milestones while demonstrating custom functions, conditionals, and interactive data visualization.
