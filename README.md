### Calculator (October, 14, 2025)

This project is a fully functional calculator built in Processing that supports both mouse clicks and keyboard input. It features a clean, visually balanced interface with a dark background, blue number buttons, and orange operation buttons for clear contrast and usability. Users can perform standard and advanced operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, and pi using either on-screen buttons or keypresses. The program uses event-driven logic to track operands, operators, and results while dynamically updating the display for a smooth and responsive user experience.
